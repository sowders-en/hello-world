==Hello-world==! My name's Elizabeth, but most people call me Liz. I'm just one human among the **8.07 billion** on our tiny planet, 
surrounded by **200 billion trillion** stars within the **94 billion** light years of the universe. 
While our lives seem so small in comparison, I have a strict belief that we're here to support each other, to show kindness, and to help each other learn and grow. 
And that, by no means, is a small feat at all. 

Job wise, the past 10 years i've been involved with pastry. While I love the thrill of being creative, and making from scratch, 
there comes a time in your life when you're called to do something new. A couple of years ago I came across a coding book and bought it on a whim, 
and for a long time it sat in moving boxes untouched. Little did i know that opening that book, and taking some time to dive in and 
explore it's contents would ignite a burning interest to forge forward on a new career path. I'm really looking forward to, and am so grateful for the opportynity 
to be able to participate and learn coding with Code Kentucky!
